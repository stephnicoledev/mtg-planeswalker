## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

- Utilized CSS Flexbox to ensure a responsive design.
- Set up event listeners for when a user clicks on a planewalker.
- Utilized DOM manipulation to display relevent information on each planeswalker and an option to find out more if the user desires.

## Lessons Learned:

There was a huge "AHA!" moment as I was coding the JavaScript for this project. Initially, I had large and repetitive functions for each planeswalker and knew there had to be a way to make the code cleaner. I asked myself if I could add each planeswalker's information to an object and call on that object in the function. When I tried that out and it worked I jumped in my chair! That was an awesome moment to have and I was proud of my progress.
